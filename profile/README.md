Verdagraph is a collection of open source tools that seek to empower the collaborative planning, tracking, and automation of agro-ecological systems. It currently consists of a garden productivity application and a smart irrigation controller.

The goals of Verdagraph can be summarized into three points:
- **Garden Productivity Engine:** An interactive model of plants and the environment which facilitates the data-driven planning of productive gardens and the collaborative coordination of labour.
- **Agro-Ecology Optimization Model:** A model which captures the relationship between agriculture and the broader ecological system, with the goal of producing a healthy abundance and diversity of food while minimizing reliance on the depletion of resources and the distruption of ecology.
- **IoT Automation Suite:** An Internet-of-Things (IoT) platform which serves as an extensible interface for integration with external devices and a set of embedded devices designed to automate the process of obtaining measurements and executing tasks.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://verdagraph.org) for more information.

The project currently is made up of two repositories:
- [Webapp](https://github.com/Verdagraph/Webapp) contains the web application including SvelteKit frontend and Fastify backend.
- [Drip](https://github.com/Verdagraph/Drip) contains an embedded IOT irrigation controller.
